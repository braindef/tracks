Subaqueous Gating Project

This Ableton Live set uses routing and Dummy Clips to create interesting Gating effects. This way you can take any audio signal, and or multiple tracks, and send them to a Gate Bus to add interesting gating.

The Gate Bus also has an Audio Effect Rack to show how you can manipulate the effect after the gating to add even more tripy and evolving sounds. 

To use simply open the Abelton Live project. This will work for Live 8 and 9.

Then you can experiement with the technique.

When you are in any other Live set in Ableton Live you can also navigate with your browser to the Subaqueous Gating Project and drag in the Gating Bus. Then you just need to set your Send and Return routing to be on your way.


Enjoy the complex and evolving sound you can get from this technique.
