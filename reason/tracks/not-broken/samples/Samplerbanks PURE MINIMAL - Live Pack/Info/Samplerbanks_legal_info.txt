HOPEFULLY YOU ARE THE OWNER OF A LEGAL VERSION RATHER THAN AN ILLEGAL, PIRATED COPY OF THIS PRODUCT. IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE LOYALTY AND HONESTY OF PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF THAT SAMPLERBANKS CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND CREATE INNOVATIVE AUDIO PRODUCTS. IN CASE YOU MANAGED TO GET A HOLD OF THIS WITHOUT PAYING, WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT YOU COME TO SAMPLERBANKS.COM AND DO THE RIGHT THING: PAY FOR THAT.

VERY IMPORTANT: You may use the sounds **in combination** with other sounds within your musical compositions which also include soundtracks of such as films, video productions, radio/TV programs or commercials, computer games and multimedi presentations, library music, etc. So, you should use these sounds as ** part of a musical composition with other sounds **. 

An example: if you are the original customer of a sample pack and you used sounds from it to create the soundtrack of a television commercial, simply by combining a drum loop sample with a synthesizer loop sample, and the TV advert was broadcast hundreds of times, you would keep all royalties that the advert earns you, because you have purchased a private license to use the sounds commercially. However, you cannot use the sounds ** in isolation (i.e. when not within musical compositions) ** as part of a commercially released project - for instance you cannot use the sounds to make another sample package, single effects on a website or any multimedia production - unless as part of a composition with other sounds.

You may modify these sounds and release such compositions commercially without payment of any further fees or royalties for such usage. 


Thanks for your support and enjoy your product!
